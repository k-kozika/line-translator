#### **A LINE Account for Translation Running on GAS**
> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is already in **maintenance mode**. There are a number of reasons for this, the biggest being that I wanted to *leave LINE*.

Dependabot pull requests and pull requests for additional features are welcome.  
I will try to address issues related to problem-solving and bug fixes. However, new features will no longer be actively developed, and I will no longer fund the execution infrastructure.
**Note:** If you run my bot, it may face rate limitations in the future due to lack of infrastructure support.
